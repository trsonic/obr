Open Binaural Renderer Patent License 1.0

License Terms.

1.1. Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
     Licensor, on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and their successors in
     interest and assigns, grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, worldwide,
     non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this License)
     patent license, under its Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer for
     sale, import or distribute the Software.

1.2. Conditions.

1.2.1. Availability. As a condition to the grant of rights to Licensee to make,
       sell, offer for sale, import or distribute the Software under Section
       1.1, Licensee must license its Necessary Claims available under this
       License, and Licensee must reproduce this License with the Software as
       follows:

       a. For distribution in source code, by including this License in the
          root directory of the source code with the Software.

       b. For distribution in any other form (including in hardware or in
          binary, object form, and/or hardware description code (e.g., HDL,
          RTL, Gate Level Netlist, GDSII, etc.)), by including this License in
          the documentation, legal notices, and/or other written materials,
          whether in softcopy or hardcopy form or by providing a website link
          thereto provided with such Software.

1.2.2. Additional Conditions and Acknowledgements. This license is directly
       from Licensor to Licensee. Licensee acknowledges as a condition of
       benefiting from the License that no rights are received under this
       License from any other parties, including parties performing activities
       on behalf of Licensor or its subsidiaries.

1.2.3. No-Charge Nature of this License. Licensor and Licensee each acknowledge
       and agree that the rights granted and/or the obligations undertaken by
       the other party have value, including monetary value, and that the value
       provided by Licensor and the value provided by Licensee under this
       License are equal and do not require additional monetary compensation.
       Absent such exchange of value, the license granted in Section 1.1 would
       not be of a no-charge basis.

1.3. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee, its Affiliates, or its agents
     initiate or file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in an Action
     against another entity or any person (“Litigating Entity”), all rights
     granted under this License to Licensee and its Affiliates are immediately
     terminated as of the date of the initiation of such Action unless
     1) initiation of such Action was in response to a corresponding Action
     first brought against such Litigating Entity, or 2) that Action was
     brought to enforce the terms of this License (including intervention in a
     third-party action by a Licensee).

1.4. Disclaimers. The Software and Specification are provided “AS IS” and
     without warranty. The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using
     the Software or Specification is assumed by the implementer and user.
     Licensor expressly disclaims any warranties (express, implied, or
     otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability,
     non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to
     the material. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
     LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY
     KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT,
     TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER
     PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
